# AI-Based Disk Scheduling Algorithms

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements and compares **AI-based disk scheduling algorithms** with traditional scheduling methods such as **First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF), and SCAN**. The goal is to **optimize disk seek time** and improve performance using AI-based predictive models.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Traditional Algorithms**: FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK
- ✅ **AI-Based Scheduling**: Uses machine learning to predict optimal request order
- ✅ **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Built using Tkinter for easy interaction
- ✅ **Performance Metrics**: Total seek time, request order visualization
- ✅ **Modular Code Structure**: Easy to extend and modify
